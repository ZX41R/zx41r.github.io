## Hi — I’m Zohir (aka 𝙽!𝙻)

I’m 20 years old and I study in my third year at ESTIN (Higher School of Computer Science & Technology).  
I’m a CTF player, a curious tinkerer, and someone who gets weirdly excited by crash dumps and stubborn bugs.

I’ve been to **150+ CTF events** and those hours of puzzling built my habits: try fast, fail often, and learn the one trick that makes the next exploit click. But speed isn’t the whole story — I also slow down to actually understand real binaries, OS behavior, and why things fail the way they do.

## How I got here

It started with puzzles — picoCTF, TryHackMe, the little wins that teach you how to think. The puzzles opened doors: static reversing, quick dynamic checks, and then the deeper questions about why a program behaved the way it did.

From there I moved into OS internals and reversing. Studying internals felt like learning the machine’s grammar: once you know the rules, you can ask better questions. That naturally led to exploring how those rules can be bent or broken — and that’s how exploitation, kernel attack surfaces, and eventually malware development entered the picture.

I’m not doing this for drama. I do it because I want to *understand* — both how the system works and how it can be misused — so I can design better defenses and build stronger, safer tools.

## What I study & practise

- **Windows internals:** debugging processes/threads, tracing module loads, following handles, reproducing crashes and turning them into explanations. I learn by doing — experiment, instrument, and write down the exact steps so I don’t forget.  
- **Reverse engineering:** static + dynamic, function → flow → structure. CTF writeups train speed; real binaries train patience.  
- **forensics (4n6):** quick triage checklists, finding injected or hollowed processes, extracting artifacts that reveal truth when files vanish.  
- **Malware development & analysis:** I’m a maldev student and researcher — building small, controlled lab tests to explore persistence, communication, evasion, and how analysts detect or miss behavior.  
- **Exploitation goals:** kernel abusing and Windows privilege/kernel exploitation — this is where I want to get very good.

## Where I practise (some of my playgrounds)

- picoCTF — https://play.picoctf.org/users/zx41r  
- TryHackMe — https://tryhackme.com/p/Zx41R  
- CyberDefenders — https://cyberdefenders.org/p/Zx41R/  
- I also learn from pwn.college-style practicals, practical OS exercises, and a lot of hands-on reversing labs.

## A short, honest line

I study every day. I research. I break things in a lab so I can put them back together with notes. I’m learning kernel abuse and Windows exploitation because that’s the hardest, messiest part that actually matters in the real world — and I love the work even when it’s frustrating.
