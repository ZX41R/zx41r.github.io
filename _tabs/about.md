## Hi, I'm 𝙽!𝙻

Welcome to my personal archive.

I’m a security researcher and CTF player with **150+ events** behind me. This site is where I keep the parts of the journey that matter: the experiments that worked, the debugging sessions that didn’t, the weird corner cases, the lessons that only show up after you stare at a crash dump for too long, and the notes that I wish existed when I started.

If you’re into **reverse engineering**, **OS internals**, **memory forensics**, or **malware analysis/development**, you’re in the right place.

## What this blog is

This blog is not a “portfolio” page and it’s not meant to be polished marketing.

It’s a **technical notebook**:

- Writeups from CTF challenges (and the techniques behind them)
- Reversing notes (static + dynamic analysis)
- Low-level systems topics (Windows/Linux internals, process/memory details, debugging)
- Forensics notes (memory artifacts, triage patterns, what to look for first)
- Malware-focused research (understanding behavior, persistence, evasion ideas, tradecraft lessons)

Sometimes I’ll publish full solutions. Sometimes I’ll publish partial notes that are still useful. Either way, the goal is to stay honest and build a trail I can reference later.

## The themes I care about

### Reverse engineering

I like breaking software apart and rebuilding understanding from the bottom up:

- Recognizing compiler patterns
- Identifying control flow tricks
- Extracting protocols and file formats
- Recovering data structures and intent from “just bytes”

Tools change; the mindset doesn’t.

### OS internals

I’m interested in how the system really behaves:

- Processes/threads, handles, modules
- Memory layout, paging concepts, allocations
- Debugging at user-mode and kernel-adjacent boundaries
- Why things crash (and what the crash is trying to tell you)

This is where “security” starts making sense.

### Memory forensics (4n6)

Memory is where you can catch the truth:

- What’s running vs what claims to be running
- What was injected, hollowed, mapped, or staged
- What artifacts remain even when files disappear

I like building repeatable mental checklists and workflows.

### Malware analysis and development

Understanding malware means understanding both sides:

- How payloads execute, persist, and communicate
- How analysis is evaded and how analysts counter that
- What tradecraft looks like when it meets reality

I treat this as **research and learning**—the focus here is analysis and defensive understanding, plus controlled lab experiments.

## What I’m trying to achieve

This page is long because my goal is long-term.

Here’s what I want this site to become over time:

1. **A reliable personal knowledge base**
	- I want to be able to search my own notes and instantly remember the technique, the command, the pitfall, and the fix.

2. **A trail of improvement**
	- Better writeups, deeper analysis, cleaner methodology.

3. **A bridge between CTF skills and real binaries**
	- CTFs train speed and creativity.
	- Real-world reversing trains patience, verification, and humility.
	- I want to connect both worlds.

4. **A place where I can publish experiments**
	- Small tools
	- Notes from debugging sessions
	- Mini research topics that don’t fit into “one post, one result”

---

## My approach

When I write technical posts here, I try to follow a simple approach:

- **Reproduce first** (make the behavior reliable)
- **Observe second** (instrumentation, logs, tracing, debugger)
- **Explain third** (what is happening and why)
- **Generalize last** (how to recognize and reuse the technique)

If I can’t explain something clearly, I treat it as “not understood yet” and I’ll keep digging.

## What you’ll find here (content types)

Expect posts like:

- CTF writeups (pwn/rev/misc/forensics—whatever I’m actively grinding)
- Reverse engineering walkthroughs (functions → flow → structures → behavior)
- OS internals notes (concepts explained through experiments)
- Malware behavior breakdowns (in a lab environment)
- Memory forensics notes (artifacts, triage hints, tooling habits)

## One last thing

If you’re reading this because you’re also getting into reversing, OS internals, or malware analysis:

- Stay curious.
- Build labs.
- Break things safely.
- Take notes.
- Learn to love the debugger.

This blog is my way of doing exactly that.

If you want me to include a short “quick facts” section (location, main OS, favorite tools, CTF platforms, languages), tell me what you want listed and I’ll add it.
